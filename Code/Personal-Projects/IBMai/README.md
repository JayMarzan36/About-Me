#Playing around with IBM's open source code AI

Recently I have been on a AI adventure, I have been playing around with software to run AI's aswell as running them in python.

And when I saw that IBM open sourced their granite AI models that are meant for coding. I though I would play around with it.

I wont have the AI model files in this repository cause they are fairly big. And you can find them on huggingface.

And you can have the model use CUDA instead of running on the cpu, but that requires a Nvidia gpu which I don't have
