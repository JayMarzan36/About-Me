# Overview
I had made a random password generator before. 

I was proud of it no doubt, but would use the terminal and at the time was getting sick of using the terminal.

So I decided to translate it and make it work with a GUI. I messed around with pyautogui but I didn't feel like it was very straightforward to use.

And I decided it was time to learn another GUI. And I settled on TKinter.

At the moment I don't think the code is written well and I'm planning on rewriting it to be self-documenting. Future me problem.
